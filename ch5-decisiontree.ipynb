    "Decision tree, especially CART (Classification and regression tree) implement greedy algorithm in tree construction. It is O(nm log m) time complexity where n is the number of features and m is the number of samples.  \n",
    "Since, at each level, the model will choose at most n values from n features to compare with m samples, thus nm. The average level of the tree is log(m) assume that in each level, the sample is divided by half.  \n",
    "So, if the m is increased by 10 folds, the training time will be incrased by 10log10 --> 33 folds."
